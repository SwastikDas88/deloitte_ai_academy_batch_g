    "## 1. Create a ndarray of first five multiples of 6.\n",
    "## 2. Convert the 1D array created in Q1 to 3D, and display the number of dimensions of the latter.\n",
    "## 3. Create a 2D array where first 5 prime numbers occupy the 1st dimension & the first 5 composite numbers in the 2nd \n",
    "##    dimension.\n",
    "## 4. From the array created in Q3, retrieve the last element from 2nd dimension.\n",
    "## 5. Retrieve the 2nd, 3rd and 4th elements from both dimensions of the 2D array created in Q3.\n",
    "## 6. Display the data type of the array created in Q1, and change it to float.\n",
    "## 7. Create a 1D array of twelve zeros and reshape it to a 2D array of shape (3,4).\n",
    "## 8. Flatten the 2D array that you created in the previous question back to 1D.\n",
    "## 9. Consider an array [24,45,67,90,123,367]. Find the indexes where the values are even.\n",
    "## 10. Create two arrays, one with first 5 odd numbers and the other with first 5 even numbers. \n",
    "##     Then concatenate both the arrays along columns.\n",
    "## 11. Subtract the even number array from the odd number array created in Q10.\n",
    "## 12. Create two matrices of the squares and cubes of first 4 natural numbers, and perform matrix multiplication. \n",
    "##     Also, obtain the transpose of the matrix resulting from the multiplication."
